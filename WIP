- Remove unnecessary test and scripts, and keep:
  - in a container without dev-deps
    - [x] test PKGBUILD produces pacman package correctly
    - [x] test PKGBUILD installs pacman package correctly (aka, command is found after installation, but do not test the command)
  - in a container with dev-deps:
    - [x] test wheel is built correctly
    - [x] after installing wheel, the expected CLI command is available
    - [x] test the Python logic invoked by the CLI, but without building or installing the wheel (usual unit/integration tests at Python level)
  - delete BASH scripts that are not needed anymore

- [ ] Add CI in GitHub actions for development branches and for master - think if they have to be different flows or they are the same
- [x] Update command names in pyproject.toml
- [x] Add "restore" command name in pyproject.toml
- [x] Add script to automatically generate new pkgbuild from template.
- [x] Add script to push pkgbuild to local AUR repo.

- [ ] Add logic to install systemd unit to regularly run the backup command
- [ ] Document how to use the systemd unit
- [ ] Document how to use the restore CLI
- [ ] Document how to use the backup CLI
- [ ] Document required config file
- [ ] Add git commit hooks for isort, flake8, black, mypy, etc.

- interpolate envvars in config paths
  - pro: not necessary to hardcode a value in the config
